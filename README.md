Running Lap Timer App

The Running Lap Timer App allows athletes to record laps with a simple start, pause, and lap interface while setting a target pace or goal time per lap.
1. Each lap is automatically compared to the goal, showing whether it was on target, too fast, or too slow.
2. Deviations are highlighted using color coding and the delta from the goal, helping runners quickly understand their pacing.
3. A tolerance range can be configured so small timing differences donâ€™t get flagged unnecessarily.

Session Summaries

Beyond live tracking, the app provides session summaries, including:
1. Average lap time
2. Best and worst laps
3. Percentage of laps on target
4. Consistency measures (standard deviation)

Athletes can save and review past sessions, export results as CSV, or share visual summaries. Optional feedback through haptics or voice cues makes this a focused training tool to practice pacing discipline, evaluate progress, and adjust in real time or after workouts.
